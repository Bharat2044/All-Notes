Azure Default Outbound Access (For VMs Without Public IPs)
When an Azure Virtual Machine does not have a public IP address, Azure still allows outbound internet connectivity through a temporary public IP under the following conditions:

✅ Conditions for Default Outbound Access:

The VM does not have a Public IP assigned.
There is no NAT Gateway configured for outbound traffic.
There is no Azure Load Balancer with outbound rules applied.

🚨 Important Notes:

This behavior is provided by Azure SNAT (Source Network Address Translation).
The outbound IP is dynamic and can change anytime.
It is not recommended for production because it's not a stable or dedicated outbound IP.
Microsoft plans to remove this feature in the future, encouraging users to configure a NAT Gateway or Load Balancer outbound rules for predictable outbound IPs.
Recommended Solutions for Reliable Outbound Access:
1️⃣ Assign a Public IP to the VM → If direct outbound connectivity is needed.
2️⃣ Use a NAT Gateway → Best practice for stable and scalable outbound connectivity.
3️⃣ Configure an Azure Load Balancer with outbound rules → If multiple VMs need outbound access.


what is the use of in that case nat?


In Azure, a NAT Gateway (Network Address Translation Gateway) is used to provide stable, scalable, and controlled outbound internet access for virtual machines (VMs) in a private subnet.

Why Use a NAT Gateway Instead of Default Outbound Access?
By default, Azure provides temporary outbound access for VMs without a public IP (via Default Outbound Access). However, this is unreliable because:
❌ The outbound IP address can change anytime.
❌ Microsoft may remove this default behavior in the future.
❌ It doesn’t support large-scale outbound traffic efficiently.

Benefits of Using a NAT Gateway in Azure
✅ Static Outbound IP Address: You can assign a fixed public IP to outbound traffic.
✅ High Availability: NAT Gateway is fully managed by Azure and scales automatically.
✅ Better Performance: Supports 64,000 concurrent flows per IP and up to 16 public IPs for large-scale outbound traffic.
✅ Security: No inbound connections are allowed (unlike traditional public IPs on VMs).

How NAT Gateway Works in Azure
Outbound traffic from VMs in a private subnet goes through the NAT Gateway.
The NAT Gateway replaces the VM’s private IP with a public IP before sending traffic to the internet.
This ensures that all outbound connections from those VMs appear to come from a single, static public IP.
When Should You Use a NAT Gateway?
🔹 If your VMs don’t have public IPs but need stable outbound internet access.
🔹 When you need multiple VMs in a private subnet to use the same fixed outbound IP.
🔹 To prevent Azure from changing outbound IPs, ensuring consistent external communication.
🔹 If you want better performance and security compared to default outbound access.
