MONOLITHIC: Deploying monolithic applications is more straightforward than deploying microservices. Developers install the entire application code base and dependencies in a single environment.

MICRO SERVICES: Microservices are deployed using VM or Containers. Containers are the preferred deployment route for microservices as containers are lighter, portable, and modular. The microservice code is packaged into a container image and deployed as a container service.
multiple services are deployed on multiple servers with multiple databases.

note: if number of application are more will go with microservices concept (docker and kubernetes)

BASED ON USERS AND APP COMPLEXITY WE NEED TO SELECT THE ARCHITECTURE.

FACTORS AFFECTIONG FOR USING MICRO SERVICES:
FLEXIBLE
COST 
MAINTAINANCE
EASY CONTROL




## ----- Docker overview ----------##
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.


DOCKER IMAGE:
Docker images are read-only templates that contain instructions for creating a container. A Docker image is a snapshot or blueprint of the libraries and dependencies required inside a container for an application to run

CONTAINERS:
A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime
its same as a server/vm.
operating system independent
 (Ec2 server=AMI, CONTAINER=IMAGE)
os will be managed in image 



-----docker install process -------


     ----root------

sudo yum install docker -y # If linux 20203

sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl status docker

Note : By default Docker works with the root user and other users can only access to Docker with sudo commands. However, we can bypass the sudo commands by creating a new group with the name docker and add ec2_user.

#First let’s create the docker group

if you install on ec2-user 

sudo groupadd docker (optional if group is not created)

#Now let’s add ec2-user to docker group

sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user

#In order to enable the changes, run the following command

newgrp docker 

sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock  # to give access docker demon to run docker server 

docker --version to check docker version

#If you want to see an extended version of the version details, such as the API version, Go version, and Engine Version, use the version command without dashes. give below command

docker version 


# ----commands:---- #

---to pull base images from public docker repository

docker pull image <imagename>

docker pull nginx or ubuntu


docker inspect image nginx  ### to check images details

docker images # to check list of images 

docker run -it imagename /bin/bash  --will enter into the container interact terminal 

docker run -dt imagename -we are not enter into the container detach terminal

docker run -dt --name <name> <imagename> 
 (to give csutome name --name)


docker ps ## to check running containers 

docker ps -a  ## to check both running and stopped containers 

docker ps -a | grep 'Exited' #to check only stopped container 



Condition-1----- running container login

## To login container ##
docker exec -it <continername or continerid> /bin/bash # to login running container

1.if you want to come out from container without stop give "ctrl p+q" or exit (container already running while login time so no impact)

condition-2-------create container from image and login 

## To login container ##
docker run -it <imagename> /bin/bash # to create container from image and also interactive (login mode)

1.if you want to come out from container without stop give "ctrl p+q"

2.if you give "exit"  container also will stop

Condition-3-------run container detach mode 

docker run -dt <imagename>  (detach mode not going to be interacted with container)

After if we want login "docker exec -it <continername or continerid> /bin/bash"


ps -ef   --to know how many processors running if it is in vm many process we can see but it is in container onle few becuase its light weight 

ps -ef | wc -l #to know number of processors request running backend






#### how to start container#####

docker start <containerid>
          or
docker start <container name>

#### how to stop container#####
docker stop <containerid> 
           or
docker stop <container name>

## docker kill comeplete terminated 
docker kill <containername>

docker pause cont_name	: to pause container
docker unpause cont_name: to unpause container
docker inspect cont_name: to get complete info of a container
docker logs <containerid>: to check the logs



## danger commands##

#### deleting process ######
## Images -----

docker rmi <imagename> ##to delete image if image is not tagging to any container weather it is running or stopped 

docker rmi <imageID> -f #forcrfully delete image even respective container weather it is running or stopped

docker system prune -a to remove all images (if images are tag to stopped containers)


 ## container ------
docker rm <containername or containerid> ### to remover stopped container

docker rm -f <container id> delete running and stopped container

docker container prune -- delete all stopped containers 

docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq) ---delete all running containers 







# --Enabeling port-- #

docker run -p <HOST_PORT>:<CONTAINER:PORT> IMAGE_NAME  

docker run -dt -p 3000:3000 --name project-2 ubuntu  #along port expose

===================================================================================

-------- pull jenkins----------

docker pull jenkins/jenkins

docker run -dt -p <local host port>:<container run port> --name <name of the container> <name of the image>

docker run -dt -p 8081:8080 --name jenkins container jenkins/jenkin

access the jenkins with public ip and port number (8081)
