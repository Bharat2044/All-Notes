1.Create one ec2 in private subnet(1a) and one more ec2 in public subnet(1a) connect private instance via bastion host process 
and add sample application  

2.Create Tg and add private server in to it.

3.Create alb and select avaialability zones 1b,1c az's only and configure tg and access with alb url will see able to acces or not 

4.Modify ALB and add subnet 1a also now you can try to access your application by using ALB url

Note: To create elb, we should create at least two public subnest in different Avaialability zones.
so try to unders howmany subnets (Public and private) are reuired first 


Does ALB redirects Traffic to unselected AZ?

An Application Load Balancer (ALB) in AWS is designed to distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets, 
such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, across one or more Availability Zones (AZs). 
Here are some key points regarding ALB and traffic distribution across Availability Zones:

Traffic Distribution and Availability Zones
Selected Availability Zones: When you create an ALB, you specify the Availability Zones where it will operate. 
The ALB will create a load balancer node in each of the specified Availability Zones. 
These nodes are responsible for handling and distributing incoming traffic to the targets within those zones.

Unselected Availability Zones: ALB does not route traffic to targets in Availability Zones that are not selected during the ALB configuration. 
If an Availability Zone is not selected, there will be no load balancer node in that zone, and as a result, no traffic will be routed to it.

Traffic Distribution: Within the selected Availability Zones, the ALB will distribute incoming traffic evenly across the registered and healthy targets in those zones. 
If one of the selected zones becomes unavailable, the ALB will automatically distribute traffic to the remaining healthy zones and targets.

Ensuring High Availability
To ensure high availability and fault tolerance, it is recommended to configure your ALB to operate in multiple Availability Zones. This setup helps in the following ways:

Resilience: If one Availability Zone goes down, the ALB can still route traffic to targets in the other zones.
Load Distribution: Evenly distributes traffic to prevent overloading any single Availability Zone or target.
Example Scenario
Let's say you have an ALB configured with the following Availability Zones:

Selected AZs: us-east-1a, us-east-1b, and us-east-1c.
In this configuration:

The ALB will have load balancer nodes in us-east-1a, us-east-1b, and us-east-1c.
It will distribute traffic only to targets within these selected zones.
If a target is in us-east-1d (an unselected AZ), the ALB will not route traffic to this target.
How to Configure Availability Zones for an ALB
Create or Modify an ALB: When you create or modify an ALB in the AWS Management Console, you can select the Availability Zones.
Select Subnets: For each selected Availability Zone, you must specify at least one subnet. The load balancer nodes will be created in these subnets.

Example Steps in the AWS Management Console

Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard: Go to the Load Balancers section.
Create a New Load Balancer: Click on “Create Load Balancer” and choose “Application Load Balancer.”
Configure Load Balancer: Provide a name, select the scheme (Internet-facing or internal), and select the IP address type.
Availability Zones: Under the Availability Zones section, select the desired VPC and the Availability Zones along with their corresponding subnets.
Configure Security Settings: Set up security groups and listener configurations.
Register Targets: Add the instances or other targets you want the ALB to route traffic to.
Summary
Traffic Routing: ALB only routes traffic to targets in the selected Availability Zones.
High Availability: To achieve high availability, configure the ALB to span multiple Availability Zones.
Unselected AZs: Targets in unselected Availability Zones will not receive traffic from the ALB.
By carefully selecting the Availability Zones and configuring the ALB appropriately, you can ensure optimal traffic distribution and high availability for your applications.




Example :

ALB Node Creation
When you configure an ALB, AWS creates load balancer nodes in each selected Availability Zone. 
These nodes handle the incoming traffic and distribute it to the registered targets (instances, containers, IP addresses) within the same AZ.

Impact of Unselected AZs
No Load Balancer Node: If an AZ is not selected during the ALB configuration, there is no load balancer node in that AZ. 
Consequently, the ALB cannot route traffic to instances located in that AZ.
Ignored Targets: Instances in the unselected AZs will remain in the target group but will not receive any traffic.
Example Scenario
ALB Configuration:

Selected AZs: us-east-1a, us-east-1b
Unselected AZ: us-east-1c
Instances:

Instance A in us-east-1a
Instance B in us-east-1b
Instance C in us-east-1c (added to the target group but in an unselected AZ)

In this scenario:

Instance A and Instance B: Will receive traffic from the ALB as they are in the selected AZs.
Instance C: Will not receive any traffic from the ALB because it is in us-east-1c, which is not a selected AZ.

Note : In this process application has to deploy in private servers only not in public
