Spring Batch Tutorial
=========================

Spring Batch is a powerful framework for processing large volumes of data in a batch-oriented way. 

Itâ€™s part of the Spring Framework and provides reusable functions essential for processing data, such as logging, transaction management, job processing statistics, and more. 

Here are some key components and concepts of Spring Batch:


		- ItemReader
		- ItemProcessor
		- ItemWriter
		- Step
		- Job
		- JobRepository
		- JobLauncher

ItemReader : It is used to read data from the source 

ItemProcessor : It is used to process the data

ItemWriter : It is used to write the data to destination

Step : It represents sequence of our batch execution (reader + processor + writer)

Job : It is used to represents set of steps for batch processing

JobRepository : To maintains job execution history and steps info

JobLauncher: It is used to start the job exeuction.
