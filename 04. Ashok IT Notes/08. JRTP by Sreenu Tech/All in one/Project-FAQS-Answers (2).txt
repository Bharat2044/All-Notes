1. Can you introduce yourself or May i know about your or tell me about yourself?

Sol : 
	Hi, I am Sreenivas postgraduation completed from jntu and having 4 yrs of experience in Java and J2ee, spring boot and 	microservices technologies Currently i am working as Software Engg or Sr.S/w Engg in TCS, During my experience i got the 	opportunity to work mutliple domains like banking, insurance ..etc on different tech stack like microservices, spring boot, 	aws, docker,jdk8 and also some realtime tools like Git, maven, jenkins, sonarqube, junit..etc

		Tell me about yourself = exp, role, current company, domain, techstack


2. Can you explain your current project?

	My current project name is COMS which stands for card offers management system
	The main objective of COMS product is customer can get the list of eligible offers 
	based on the card type and usage of the
	card.These offers can be categoried into differt types such as membership offers, 
	personalized offers and generalized offers
	There are 4 modules has introduced to enable these offers
	
		1. batch module   : to update the offers for specified time in non business hours using spring batch
		2. service module : this module is used to develope the microservices
		3. web module 	  : this module is used to devlope the web applications for the customers
		4. admin module   : ths module is used to manage these offers by business team/stakeholders


	1. batch module :

		1. As you know, these batch jobs will be executed without user interaction using schedules/cron expression
	           Generally batch jobs will be executed non business hours ( i.e. no traffic )
		2. This module is used to collect the different types offers from all the source systems
		3. process the offers data by removing inactive and expired offers
		4. send/write these offers destination location


	2. service module :

	1. using this modules we can develope the microservices, as part of this requirement we have developed 4 microservices

		a. offers-service	: This service is used to get the list of offers
		b. enrollment-service   : This service is used to verify the card is enrolled for  membership offers 
		c. card-verify-service  : This service is used to verify the card numbers status like active, cvv validations..etc
		d. user-auth-service	: This service is used to authenticate the request. i.e. validate the access token


	3. web module : This module is used to display the all the eligble offers on UI, so that customer can able to use these
			offers

	4. admin module : This module will be used by business team to manage (create/update/delete) the offers for specific type
			  of cards

	

3. Can you explain your project architecture?

Sol :  Project Architecture =  How the different systems can communicate with each other.

	1. Rest API/Service
	2. Redis Cache
	3. AWS S3 - to store offer image
	4. Database (Mysql/postgres)
	5. Batch component
	6. KAFKA
	

	a. project architecture without microservices
	b. project architecture with microservices

	Implementation Steps:

		1. we have developed rest api's using microservice architecture
		2. If the rest api want become microservices then it should follow 12 factor principles
		   of microservices 

			https://12factor.net/

		3. Every microservice should have its own/individual git repositories. Here in this coms 		   project we have developed 4 microservices .i.e. no.of microservices = no.of git repositories
		   each microservice has single code base and single deployable artifact

		4. spring cloud config server : To externalize the configuration

			-->all the configuration related properties files will be moved to git repo
			-->our source code will get the configuration details from git repo, if any 				   configuration changes required then we should update in git repo configuration files
			   instead of touching the source code
			

		5. Eurek Server or Discovery Server: 

			-->It is used to register/maintain all the microservices instance/ipaddress details
			-->Eureka will expose the rest api's, all the microserivces use that api to register
			   the services instances and get the instance details of other services
			-->If 2 service want connect with each other then get the instance details of the 
			   from Eureka instead of hardcode the service2 url in  the service1 source code

		6. Every microservices has single database

		7. microservices shouldn't dependent on other system
	
		8. configure each microservice has separate CICD (continuous integration and continuation 		   deployment) pipeline to enable auto build and deploy the application

		9. configuration api gateway to expose the services to clients/consumers instead of exposing
		   directly all the service consumers
					
		       =====================================================		  
							   |---service-3    |
			consumer ----->api gateway---------|---service-1    |
							   |---service-2    |
		       =====================================================

	Microservices FAQ's:
	====================

		1. difference monolithic and microservices
		2. when we can say a service is called microservices or how to convert normal api should
		   convert to microservices
		3. what is api gateway ? how it works?
		4. How to trace the logs? How are we implemented distributed logging?
		5. How spring batch will work in this architecture?



4. Can you explain your project technical flow or Layered Architecture?

Sol : a.  We need to explain first layered architecture

	  As we know, rest api/microservices is a distributed application, every distributed application should
          follow the layered architecture where will have 3 layers, controller layer, service layer, intg layer
		  
		http/json			    request		 request            request
	client----------------->Controller Layer ------->Service Layer--------->Intg Layer------->backend sys

		
      b.  we should explain each and every class how it works	

	  explain same as sequnece diagram flow

	
		i. OffersController will receive the request from the client/consumer
		ii. send the request to OfferReqValidator class to validate the request .
		    if the request is valid then proceed further else it will send error/exception to 			    controller, Controller will prepare the error response and send to client/consumer.
		iii. controller will call service layer
			
		
		
5. Can you explain how are you implemented security in your project?

Sol :  Case 1 : If you are not confident/clear on security topic -- jr.developers (1-3 yrs exp)

	 I didn't get chance to work on security but i know how we have implemented in our project
	 explain how the OAuth will work like importance of AuthorizationServer, ResourceServer
		

	Case 2 : If you are confident

	 We have implemented different types of security in our project

		1. SSL 		2. OAuth 2.0

	  Can you explain how SSL works?

		1. validate the certifacte and establish secure connection so that transactions will be
	           in secure (encrypted formate)
		 
		
	 Can you explain how OAuth 2.0 will work?

		To implment OAuth 2.0 we required 4 roles :

	  1. Authorization Server 2. Resource Server 3. client application  4. resource owner

	  
	  -->Our application was registered with AuthorizationServer to get the clientid, secret key, 		     redirectional url. 

 	 -->First every microservice will call Authorization Server by sending the details like 
	    clientid, secret key, redirectional url, username, password..etc. Authorization will validate
	    the details and generate the accessToken (/oauth/token) and shared to service

	-->Now microservices has auth-token/bearer token/authorization token from Authorization, use this
	   token for authentication and send this token for calling every microserivces

	-->once microservices/resource server will receive the request along with accessToken, validate the
	   token by calling AuthorizationServer validate api (/oauth/validate), AuthorizationServer will
	   send response to microservices. If the token is valid the process the request (i.e. contoller--service--intg layer..etc) else it will give eror response to client saying 401 - unauthorized client..etc

	-->SpringBoot has provided predeifned annoatations like @EnableAuthorizationServer which will expose
	   2 endpoints 

		1. /oauth/token : It will validate the credentials, client, secret key and generate the token
		2. /oauth/validate: It will validate the token, if the token is valid then decrypt the token
				    get the required details from token, send to client

	


6. What are the problems or risks you have faced in this project or till your experience?

Sol :  Problem 1 : Spring Scopes were configured wrongly

       Problem 2 : Multithreading Implementation issue

	-->Implemented multithreading using java.util.concurreny api but forgot to shutdown the threads
	-->Every day traffic would be 1000 requests
		
		day1 --> 1k request --- 10 threads are created ---> thread pool
		day2 --> 2k request --- 10  threads are create ---> thread pool : 20 
		:
		:
		day 10 -->                 100 threads ---- heap memory issues - out of memory

		Application was Down --- Production Support Team monitor the application logs 24/7
		If any Top Error will come they will raise the incident

		Incident -- Seviority1 -- P1 --- all the users impacted
		Incident -- Seviority1 -- P2 --- less  users impacted

				
		

7. How can you improve the application (api/web) performance?		

Sol : Problem Statement : 

	I have developed one rest api long back, It is taking 10 sec response time
	How can we bring from 10 sec to 2 sec or 1 sec? What are the best practices you will do to improve performance?
	
	
	1. First i will try to understand the service architecture and will come to know that 
		
		a. Service is interacting with how many dependent system/backend systems/down stream system
		b. Is that Service is using any caching, any third party api's

	2. I will collect/get the response times for each backend system

					 	|---backend1 (4 sec)
			services1 --------------|---backend2 (3 sec)	
					 	|---bacckend3 (2 sec)
			  

			service resp time = backend1 resptime + backend2 resp time + backend3 resptime + processing
				
				resp time = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 sec
					  = 10 sec


	3. With this response time, i will get to know the Root Cause of the issues 
	   ( i.e. which backend system is the culprit , is taking more time )

	4. I will do analysis like are all the backends invocation sequnetially? or parallel?

		a. If it is sequential? will check is really sequnetial calls are required here? Is ther any way we can convert
	           sequnetial calls into parallel calls

			resp time = max (4 , 3 ) + 2 + 1 sec  // assume convert sequential calls into parallel calls of back1, back2
					  = 10 sec
				  = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

			resp time = max (4, 3, 2) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 sec // convert all the sequnetial calls to parallel calls

	5. Identify is there any duplicate calls and can we remove the duplicate calls? 

			service 1 required some response . i.e. 30  elements

		long back - 5 years back

						|---backend1 (4 sec)  -- 20 elements
			services1 --------------|---backend2 (3 sec)  -- 6  elements	 
					 	|---bacckend3 (2 sec) -- 4  elements

		
			service 1 = combine all the backend response


		based on client requirements so manychanges made in backend1 for other purpose


			
						|---backend1 (4 sec)  -- 26 elements
			services1 --------------|---backend2 (3 sec)  -- 6  elements	 // remove 
					 	|---bacckend3 (2 sec) -- 4  elements


			service 1 = combine all the backend response = 20 + 6 + 4


 
						|---backend1 (4 sec)  -- 26 elements
			services1 --------------|---bacckend3 (2 sec) -- 4  elements


				response time = 6 = 4 + 2
				respose time  = 4 = max(4,2)

	6. Identify the data pattern, is the data is same or changing for each request? i.e. data is static or dynamic

		a. If the data is static for 30 mins or 1 hour..etc then use cache

		   if we implement cache, first req will goto backend system to get the data and store into cache. i.e. more time
		   from second request onwords it will get the data from cache instead of going to backend. So network calls will
		   be reduced.

			with backend may take = 4 sec or more  for all the request
			with cache = 1st req will take 4 sec, from second req onwords it will take < milli seconds

	7. If all the backends are good then it is giving good response then we need to check is there any opportuity in our
	   source code like 

		a. are we creating unncessary objects
		b. writing bad code which will take more time to execute
		c. threads configuration is properly or not
		d. write the code in less no.of lines usign jdk8 stream api to reduce the processing time.
		e. use string utility classes at right places
		:
		:

		
8. How are you deploying your application into production? or Can you explain the deployment process model?
   or  How the code will move from lower environment (dev, test, uat) to higher environment (prod) ( dev --> test --> uat --> prod)

		

Sol : 	Our develops team has enabled CICD pipeline

	Once we develop the code and push the changes into git repo, then Jenkins will trigger the pipeline will be triggered to 	Perform build and deploy the application into servers

	
	1. Perform the CI (Continues Integration) like 

		 a. clone the source code from git repo
		 b. compile the source code 
		 c. execute the unit testcases
		 d. generate code coverage report
		 e. execute the security scanning using SonarQube, if any major vulnerabilities found then build will failure
		    else it will proceed further steps
		f. Generate the jar
		g. build the docker image
		h. push the image into docker container registry ( Docker hub, Jfrog, eks, nexus..etc)

	2. Perform the CD ( Continues Deployment ) like 

		a. Jenkins will connect to docker container registry and get the application image
		b. Deploy the image into dev server
		c. run the image then container will start. i.e. application is running
		d. access the application
		e. If application is working in dev then deploy the image into test environment
		f. If application is working in test then deploy the image into UAT environment

		   Note : May be approvals are required to deploy the image from one environment to another environment

		g. Once the application is working in non prod i.e.

			
			dev environment -- developer should sign off
			test environment - QE team should sign off
			UAT environment -- business team/stakeholders should sign off

		   Once all the required stake holders will give sign off then move the application into production

		h. Deploy the image into production and run it, so that container will start. i.e. application is running in prod

10. what methodologies you are using? or
	    Can you explain how you got the requirements from the client?

	  Hint  : Agile Scrum methodologies : sprint, userstory, backlog, 
	  Tools : JIRA or Rally or Azure ADO


Sol :  We are following Agile (Scrum) methodologies, As we know the scrum process like we have sprint refinement, spring planning
       sprint duration. 

	1. We have product owner and business analyst in our team
	2. Product Owner will communicate with stakeholder/business team to understand requirements and add those requirements into
	   product backlog

Module 2 : Core Java
====================

	1. Which version if JDK you are using? What are the features of JDK8? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiCFAfzt9TY

	
	4. What are the collections you have used in your project? Please write the skelton/sudo code?

		a. How does HashMap internally work?
		b. How does ArrayList internally work?


	Sol : In our project we have used List to get the list of offers from the backend systems and filter the data and 
	      send this list to consumers/client

			List<Offers> offersList = new ArrayList<Offers>();

		a. How ArrayList internally will work
		b. How to remove duplicate offers?
		c. How to iterate values from the list?


	      In our project we have used Map to execute the StoredProcedure where the Procedure input is in the form of Map and
	      output also will give in the form Map.

	      			Map respMap = super.execute(reqMap);

		a. How HashMap will work internally?
		b. How to get the keys and values from the Map?
		 

5. What is polymorphism? where you have implemented in the project? write the skelton/sudo code?


	Sol :  Single task may perform multiple operations

			1. Static Polymorphism	: method overloading : writing 2 or more methods method name is same and arguments
								       are different
			2. Dynamic Polymorphism : method overriding  : parent class method is not fulfill our requirements then
								       override same method in child class to implement as per our
								       requirments


		In our project while building/preparing the response, we have used method overloading

			
	public OfferDetailsResponse buildServiceResp(CompletableFuture<OfferDetailsDaoResp> poffersResp,
			CompletableFuture<OfferDetailsDaoResp> moffersResp, CompletableFuture<OfferDetailsDaoResp> goffersResp){

	}

	public OfferDetailsResponse buildServiceResp(String respCode, String respMsg) {
	
		
	}

6. What is encapsulation? where you have implemented in the project? write the skelton/sudo code?

Sol : 		Encapsulation = Data Hiding + Abstraction

		-->Data hiding can achieved by declaring private access specifier

			private String name;

		-->Abstraction can be achieved with the help of setters and getting


			public void setAmount(int amount){


				if( amount > 10000 ){

					this.amount = amount;
				}

			 }		



	In our project we have implemented encapsulation in all the DTO/Model classes

	

7. What is String, StringBuffer, StringBuilder, toString? where you have implemented in the project? 	    write the skelton/sudo code?

		String Objects are immutable - i.e. once we create String object, if we perform any operation on this object then
					       new String object will be created

		StringBuffer Objects are mutable - once we create String object, if we perform any operation on this object 							   no need to create new StringBuffer object will be created, on same StringBuffer
						   obj it will add the new content

						- all the methods in StringBuffers class are threadsafe. i.e. only one thread will
						  allow at once. 

		StringBuilder Objects are mutable - once we create String object, if we perform any operation on this object 							    no need to create new StringBuilder object will be created, on same StringBuilder
						     obj it will add the new content

						- all the methods in StringBuilder class are not threadsafe. 
						   i.e. multiple threads will allow at once. 
						
	


8. Can you explain SOLID Principles? where you have implemented in the project?

	SOLID Principles

		1. SRP  :  Single Responsibility Principle
		2. OCP  :  Open Closed Principle
		3. LSP  : Liskov Substitution Principle
		4. ISP  : Interface Seggregation Principle
		5. DSP  : Depedency Inversion Principle 


		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMQtcVMFbn8

9. How are you handling exceptions in your project? Write the skelton/sudo code?

		a. Can you explain few of the exception names during project development? Sol : FileNotFoundException, 404, 
					BeanInstanceCreation Failed Exception
		b. Can you explain few of the exception names during project deployment?
		
		Sol : OutOfMemoryException 

		c. different types of questions like how to handle exceptions without try, catch and how to
	           handle NullPointerException

		Sol :  1. Before use the objects appl the null checks
		       2. use constant first while compare with dynamic values
		       3. don't catch NullPointerException, i.e. we shouldn't suppress/hide the NullPointerException
		       4. avoid long object length


Sol : Generally in our project we have implemented user defined exceptions or custom exceptions
	
	Based on business requirements these exceptions classified into 3 types of exceptions

		1. RequestInvalidException : request data validations

		2. BusinessException : Data Error
    
		3. SystemException   : System Error

	All are checked exceptions


10. What is enum? How does it works? diff between enum and constant?
11. How are we implemented Multithreading in your project? Can you explain?




Module 4 : Rest API & Microservices

	1. Have you worked on provider side or consumer side? Sol : I have worked on both provider as well as consumer

	2. Write the skelton/sudo code how you have developed the service?

	3. Can you write skelton/sudo code how you will make rest api calls? Using RestTmple or Microservice client 

	4. How are you testing rest API? postman or swagger

	5. Rest API error code ?  200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 403, 500, 503..etc

	6. microservices vs monolithic

	7. Realtime Usecase 

			a. If we modify the service how can avoid the impact for all the consumers
			b. What are the reatlime problems you have faces?
			c. how are you handling timeout scenarios

				ex : response time : 1 sec,  <500 ms

				every api should response <500 ms, except complex requirements like build dashboard ..etc it will
				take morethan 2 sec or 4 sec..etc

	8. How inter service communication happend? write the skelton code

			There 3 ways 2 microservices can communicate with each other

				a. DiscoveryClient	b. RibbonClient		c. FeignClient  ===> using microservice architecture

				1. RestTemplate
				2. HttpClient		=====> Without Microservices
				3. Jaxrs
				4. Jersy

	9. How does api gateway will work?

	10. How the service can be resilient?

Always upstream system (microservice) should operate (up and running) even though downstream systems are down or not responding

We can achieve this resilient using one of the below pattern based on use case

	1. Time Limiter	   : @TimeLimiter
	2. Rate Limiter    : @RateLimiter
	3. Retry Mechanism : @Retry
	4. Circuit Breaker : @CircuitBreaker
	5. Bulk Head	   : @BulkHead
