Docker Introduction:
===================

 Virtualization:

	Virtualization is technic or a mechanism through which we can run multiple parallel isolated 
	enironments on single computer/machine through the help of using Hypervisor software
	
	i.e. The process of splitting single machine into multiple machines is called virtulization
		

advantages:
===========

	1. each virtual machine can run their own os independent of the host os of the computer
	   so that we can easily deploy and run the software applications on different operating system
	   environments

	2. software applications which requires dedicated operating system of their own by creating 
	   virtual machine and installing the operating system on the vm separately

	3. Since all the virtual machines are isolated from each other and runs independent of the host
	   operating system, we can implment more security

		i.e if the host machine has compromised on security then guest machines are not impacted
	            as each vm has runs on dedicated os

	4. It is suitable for deploying and running applications that are long running processes

 dis advatanges:
 ===============

	1. VM's are heavy weight : dedicated os + resources like cpu, ram 
		
		i.e. It consumes lot of system resources in running the software applications

	2. Since VM's are heavy weight (i.e. huge in size in diskspace) and are not portable to be carried
	   acorss all the environments

	3.  Difficult to acheive CICD

	4. More cost as we need buy the os licences for all the vms

	5. Difficult to scale the vm's


To overcome all these problems, market has been introduced containerization technologies

	Containerization =  package/combine ( application code + software + configuration )
		|
	Deploy this package in all the envrionments, make sure it should work in all the enrionments/systems


 Containerization
 =================
"Containerization is technic through which we can package software applications and the corresponding
libraries/binaries which are required for running the application"

-->Multiple containers can run in parallel isolated from each other on the same machine


Advantages:
===========

	-->The containers are lightweight, in each container the operating system is not installed rather only libs/bins are 
	   packaged as part of them
	-->Since we don't install operating system as part of the container, the container images are very small in size
	   and can be easily portable across the computers
	-->Since the containers are very small in size, It is good for CICD
	-->We can optimize the physical resources of the computer by running lot of programs in parallel
	-->patching and upgradting is very easy while using containerization

Dis Advantages:
===============

	-->The containers always shares the same operating system of host, so we can't install independent operating system
	   of that host computer while using containers
	-->containers are not highly secured, if the host has bee compromised then containers also compromised
	-->only suitable for short running application


Q) when should we use virtualization and when containerization?

Sol : If we want share a physical computer and its resources between 2 parties where they wanted to run their applications on
      dedicated environment then we should use virtualization only

      If we want to run software applications isolated from each other, then we can go for containerization		
		

There are lot of containerization technology supported tools are available in market

	1. Docker
	2. Redhat Openshift		====> out of all these, Docker is most popular
	3. Mesosphere
	4. Microsoft Container

Docker :

	-->Docker is a word that is derviedfrom dock-worker, dock worker is a job of person who loads containers and un loads the
	   containers in a ship from where it has been named as 'Docker'

	-->Using docker we can implement containerization technologies where we can package software applications into docker images
	   and ship them. People can run applications packaged in docker isolated from other as containers.


	Docker workflow
		
		Developer ------------->Package------------->Ship
		Developer -------->build--->package---------->release


	How to package the Software Application : Docker Image
	How to run the packaged application	: Docker Containers

		=====================================================================================
		|Docker Image = libs and bins + appication code + required softwares + configuration|
		=====================================================================================

		Docker image is a packaged with all the required details to run the application

		Docker Container = execute/run the docker image then docker container will be created.



	Developer---- Dockerfile---->Docker engine (Docker Software )---->Docker image ---> Docker Container

How does the containers are kept isolated from each other and running on the same machine?

Sol :  As part of the linux operating system, there are lot of enhancements and features to be added to make the containers work
       on the same machine isolated from each other.

	1. Linux Namespace		2. Control Groups ( cgroups )		3. Union File System

	

	1. Linux Namespace :

		-->Docker uses below namespaces of the linux os to run containers are isolated

			1. pid = run  the container in a separate process namespace
			2. net = network namespace managing the network interface
			3. ipc = inter process communication namespace
			4. mnt = filesystem mounts
			5. uts = unit timesharing

	2. Control Groups ( cgroups ):

		-->Docker Engine uses cgroups of the linux operating system in sharing the physical resource of the computer
	 	   and limiting their usage by the container


	3. Union File System :

		-->Docker container images are packaged and assembled based on union filesystem technic




Docker Architecture:
===================

	There are 3 parts in docker architecture : 1.  Docker CLI    2. Docker Engine	3. Docker Container Registry

     
       
  1.  Docker CLI :

		-->docker CLI stands for docker command line interface, which is provided as part of the docker install
		-->There are handful docker commands that allows the users to communicate with  docker engine in managing
		   images and containers     



2. Docker Engine (Docker Software) : 

	-->It is the main component that takes care of running docker containers from an docker image
	-->There are 3 main components  : 1. docker daemon	2. docker containerd	3. runc
	

	1. docker daemon:
	   =============

		-->It is a rest api endpoint through which docker engine is exposed to the users
		-->The users can interact with docker engine by using docker cli, so that cli will send the commands over the
	           network using http protocol and communicate with docker daemon
		-->Docker daemon will receive the request (docker commands) from  users and will ask containerd to perform
		   appropriate operation

	

	2. containerd : 

		-->containerd is a component build by docker team, which takes care of building the images, pulling images
		   from container registry, convert these images into OCI image fromat and passes it as an input to the
		   runc for running a docker container

		   OCI = 1. Open Container Intiative Specification
			 2. It will standardize the way images has to build and the way containers are executed and manage the
			    Underlying operating system

	3. Runc :

		-->It is an low level component that interact with the underlying operating system of our computer in creating/
		   destroying/managing the container based on the oci image specification
			 

 
3. Docker Registry:

	-->DCR (Docker Container Registry) is a repository where docker images are published and distributed across the 
	   envrionments/world
	
	-->The docker has provided a "http://hub.docker.com" docker registry in whoch people around the world build their own
	   images publishes and distriubted to the world

	|-1. Docker Images
	|-2. Docker Containers


	Software Application Source Code ---->Build (Compile , Jar/war) ----> Deploy the application --->Run the application


	
	We should build docker image and get container from image

	To run Software Application we need below softwares are required

		1. JDK
		2. Tomcat	 + Instruction	
		3. Application
		

 Software Application to docker image steps:
 ===========================================

	1. Devops Engineer will discuss with dev team, undestand the software application requirement

	2. write the docker file

		Dockerfile
		----------

			1. Get the jdk software (jdk image)
			2. Get the tomcat software (tomcat image) + libs and bins ( To communicate with host operating system )
			3. configuration of jdk, tomcat
			4. Get the application code
			5. add the instruction to run the application ( base images like alpine, ubuntu ..etc) .
			6. get ubuntu
			:
			:

	3. Give this dockerfile to docker engine, which will execute 3 steps internally (1. docker daemon 2. containerd  3. runc)

		>docker build -t imagename dockerfile

		o/p : dockerimage  ( once the docker image has been created you can't edit or modify that imge )

		
	4. Push the images into dockerhub registries (*.images)

	5. Get/Pull the image and run the image

		>docker pull imagename : download image from docker container registry to computer
		>docker run imagename  : docker container will be generated ( i.e. application is up and running )

	6. Access the application

====================================================================================================================================


Docker Advantages:

	1. To maintain the consistency in all the environments
	2. Cost Optimization. i.e. cost saving


	Before Docker
	============

		1. mysql software -- while installing mysql operating system will allocate fixed resources like CPU and RAM
				     once it is fixed either mysql will utilize or may under utilize

		2. Tomcat Software

		3. JDK Software

		 :
		 :
		If all these software will not utilize allocated resources then these are wasting the system resources


	To overcome this issues, most of the softwaare vendors has been releasing their corresponding docker images along with 	existing supported formates

		JDK    ----------- .exe          .zip		.image
		Tomcat ----------- .exe          .zip           .image
		MySQl  ----------- .exe          .zip           .image
		Jenkins ---------- .exe          .zip           .image
		sonarqube -------- .exe          .zip           .image

							Docker Images
							   |
						-----------------------------------------
						|					|	
					Predefined Image			Userdefined Image

					jdk				1. according to the application requirements development
					tomcat				   team and devops team will have discussion
					mysql				2. devops team will prepare the dockerfile
					sonarqube			3. build the image from docker file
					jenkins				4. push the image into docker registry
					:				
					:

	1. Every Software vendor team has written dockerfile
	2. build the image
	3. push the image into docker container registry


#1. Docker Image:

	-->Docker image is a file packaged with 

		1. application binary (.jar/.war)
		2. software packages required to run the application ( like jdk, tomcat..etc )
		3. instructions in running the application
		4. bins/libs = that enables to communicate with docker engine

	all these together to run an application in an isolated environment of a computer

	
	Dockerhub is an container repository/docker registry hosted by docker team to help the people around the world to 
	publish and distribute thier own images

	To publish an docker image into a docker registry per each image we need to create an repository into which we can publish
	one image, There are 2 types of repositories

		1. public repository   : The image will be published into public repository will be open to the world and anyone
				         can use it or modify it

		2. private repository :  These repositories are used by individuals/corporate who are working on commercial/private
				         objects and don't want expose these images to the public world
					 These images can be delivered/distributed across the stages of our project.
		

	There are lot of docker images are created and published as part of docker hub registry we can categorie these image into 
	2 types

	1. docker officals/certified/verified images :

		-->These images rare created by docker/partners and are verified by the docker team and published as part of the
		   repository

	2. community images :

		-->any of the users who wanted to contribue for opensource stack can create and publish their own images which
		   are called community images and should used at our own discreation.



	For our software application inorder to containerize the application, we need to build our own docker image
	packaging the applications with instructions and bins,libs
	
	It is an usual practice to build the image of our own by extending the existing docker images

	The docker team has provided a base docker image which containers bins/libs which can used as base image from
	which we can extend and create our ownimage which is called 'alpine' of size 2 mb

	use ubuntu image instead of alpine image

	Q) Why docker images are read only?
	Q) docker images are layered and stackable?
	

#2. Docker Containers:

	-->A running process or a programs that is created out of an existing docker image that runs isolated from other process	   is called an container
	-->The lifetime of the container is dependent on the amount of time the application is running, once the application 
	   inside the container terminates the container also will get terminated

		"docker containers will be created from an docker image"

		docker container is an instance of a docker image

		we can create multiple containers from an one docker image

Docker Images:
=============

	-->There are lot of opensource docker images provided by the docker team, partners and people around
	   the world and has published to the docker hub registry

	-->If we want package our software application as docker image we can take any of the existing
	   from the dockerhub registry as a base image

	-->There are few images considered as base image like alpine, ubuntu ...etc


			prepare our own docker image  =  application binaries + software packages + 
							 configuration + libs and bins (baseimage)	

			To build our docker image, we must depend on 1 or more predefined docker images

				one docker image is mandatory ie. base image
				other docker images are optional like jdk, tomact..etc based on our application
				requirements

	
	-->The docker images are layered and stackable

	1. while we are building the image, if the docker package the base image into each application
	   the base image will be duplicated which will results in

		a. wasting the harddisk space in creating mulitple applications docker images with same
	           base image

		b. bandwidth consumption (network calls) in publishing/distributing the images will be high


	To overcome the above problem docker has comeup with layered and stackable images

	whenever we are creating an application as docker image, in our docker image we refer the existig image
	base image calld "gold copy", which is not packaged or cloned inside our image or not extended
	rather in our image we holde the reference of the goldcopy or image only, on top of application
	binary are placed and packaged.


	i.e. While building the image first time, if that image required base image then it will goto docker 	registry and download into local system. If the same base image required for multiple other docker 	images then it will check if the base image available in local system, if it is available get it from
	there by holding the reference else it will go docker registry

==============================================================================================================

Docker Software Installation:
=============================

	We can install docker software in 

		1. windows os : from windows 10 onwords we can install and run docker containers
				Docker team has provided software called "docker-desktop-windows"

			-->It is in the form of .exe file , Download docker software freely from 				   https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/

			-->double click on docker.exe file and click on next and finish
			

		2. ubuntu linux os   :

			1. sudo apt update
			2. sudo apt install -y docker-ce
			3. docker systemctl docker	
		 


		3. mac os     :   
			
				from windows 10 onwords we can install and run docker containers
				Docker team has provided software called "docker-desktop-windows"

		4. Install docker in aws EC2 machine
	

		

	There are 2 versions of the docker

		|-docker community edition	we have to install community edition, which is an opensource
		|-docker enterprise edition



  -->Once the docker software has been installed then check the version of the docker

		>docker -version

 -->docker desktop will be provided by docker software, which has docker engine already

 -->We can connect docker registry using docker desktop

					2. prepare image
					3. publish image
					4. run the image		



	How to prepare the images as per our application needs, we will see later

	How to prepare the containers with existing docker images


Docker Container commands:
==========================

	1. Get the list of container

		>docker container ls

	    we can see the running containers on docker workstation or on docker daemon

		CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES

		
		CONTAINER ID : docker engine creates unquie id and assign it to the container
		IMAGE  : whom this container as been created
		COMMAND : used in launching the container
		CREATED : when the container has been created
		STATUS  : current status of the container
		PORTS   : ports exposed out of the container
		NAMES   : for container the docker engine generates a unique random names and assign it
			  for easy reference

			  We can manage the container using either using contianer id or NAME of the container


	2. How to run a docker container interactively

		>docker caontiner run -it image:tag command

		ex : docker container run -it ubunutu:20.0 bin/bash



	3. how to run the container

		>docker container run imagename:version

		>docker container run mysql
			
		If the version is not mentioned then it will take as latest version

	

	docker engine upon receving the request for running a docker container it checks whether the docker
	image tag with specified in the local docker image workstation, if it is not available in local
	then it will connects to the docker container registry and pulls the docker image on the
	docker workstation.

	Once the image is available on the docker workstation, the docker engine creates an docker container
	out of the image and kicks start the default command written as part of the image in running the
	program inside the container.

	
	4. How to see all the containers on the macine

		>docker container ls -a

		-a = all the containers irrespective of their status

		C:\Users\HP>docker container ls -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                     PORTS     NAMES

374d645913c5   ubuntu    "bin/bash"               3 minutes ago   Exited (0) 2 minutes ago             peaceful_thompson
e1d803f9696a   ubuntu    "/bin/bash"              4 minutes ago   Exited (0) 3 minutes ago             zen_jennings

	-->when we start the container means, the application has been started
	   after completing the execution of the application, docker engine terminates the container
	   but will not removed/destroy the container, becaue people/programmers may want to collect the logs
	   generated by the container.



	5. How to remove the terminaed container?

		>docker container rm CONTAINER ID/CONTAINER NAME
		C:\Users\HP>docker container rm 6ef45b775829
		6ef45b775829

	6. how can we see all the container are running
	
		1. >docker container ls 
		2. >docker container ps

	7. how to stop an running container

		>dcoker container stop CONTAINER ID/CONTAINER NAME

	
	8. How to forcible stop and remove a running container

		>docker container rm -f CONTAINER ID/CONTAINER NAME // forcibly remove an running container

 Docker Objects		
 --------------
|---Docker Images 	: It is file which contains required information to run the application 
		    		( software appn + software packages +  bins and libs + configuration )

|---Docker Containers	: Container is an instance of an image
			: Create a program or process out of an docker image which is under execution is called 
			  container.

How to work with Docker Container:
==================================

	Assume that docker images already available ( predefined images, user defined images ), use those images How to create the
	Containers.

	1. How to run a container interactively

		>docker container run -it imagename:tag command
		>docker container run -it ubuntu bin/bash

		The above command will create docker container out of an docker image
		-it = stands for interactive execution saying execute the command specified

		Docker engine will check ubuntu image avialable in local docker workstation ( local cache) or not
		if it is available it will get it from there, else it will connect to docker registry to download the ubuntu
		image and store in docker workstation.

		Once the ubuntu image is available in local docker workstation then it will create the docker container out of an
		image

		Here command (bin/bash) is a optiona, if we will not provide the command then default command will be executed


	2. How to see the running container on the docker workstation or on docker daemon?

		>docker container ls

	3. How to see all the docker containers on the machine?

		>docker container ls -a 
			
			or

		>docker containre  ps


	Note : Container start means, program execution will start

		>docker container run mysql --- mysql container will be created out of an mysql image  . i.e. mysql server started
		>dcoker container run tomcat -- tomcat container will bt created out of an tomcat image. i.e. tomcat appn started

	Once the program execution will be completed then docker engine will terminate the docker container, but will not
	remove/destroy the docker container, because the developer may want to collect the logs generated by the container 
	


	 CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                     PORTS     NAMES



		STATUS = STOPPPED | Running | Exited 



	4. How to remove a terminatted container

		>docker container rm containerid/containername
	
	5. How to stop a running container

		>docker container stop containerid/containername

	6. How to forcible stop and remove a container

		>docker container rm -f id/name

	7. How to remove all the stopped/exited containers at one shot?

		>docker container prune

	8. How to run a docker container with a given name

		>docker container run -d --name containername image:tag
		>docker container run -d --name tomcatserver tomcat:9.0 (if tag is not provided then latest version will come)

	9. How to see the container logs
	>docker container logs id/name
	>docker container logs -f id/name where f = stands for flow, means scroll through the genrating logs the containr appn

	10. How to enter inside the container that is running

		>docker container exec -it containerid/name command

		>docker container exec -it --name tomcatserver tomcat:9.0

	11. How to check the details of a container?

		>docker container inspect id/name

		It will displays the entire information about the containers like cpu, memoty, storage, id, image, interface card
		ip address, portnos exposed...etc
