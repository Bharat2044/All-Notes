Today Session:

	-->Resilience4j patterns : circuit breaker, bulk head


circuit breaker:


		================		===============
		|product-service| ============> |Rating-Service|
		================		===============
	 
	-->product service is calling to rating server, if rating service is down due to some
	   infrastructure outage or any other reason. what will happen?

	-->If any other requests will come to rating service then will have same situation 
	   i.e. it will give failure

	
 
How to solve this problem using Circuit Breaker


	-->Circuit Breaker will behave like electrical circuit
	-->When one service get remote service calls failure morethan a given threshold then
	   for a particular time period, after that timeout expires then circuit breaker will 
	   allows limited no.of request. If those requests are getting succeded then circuit breaker
	   will be closed and normal operation will be resumed other wise it will fail.

	-->Circuit Breaker Lifecycle states


		1. CLOSED		2. OPEN 	3. HALF OPEN



	1. CLOSED : when both services interacting is up and running. i.e. no errors are getting
		    circuit breaker is counting the no.of remote api calls continuously

	2. OPEN	  : As soon as the percentage of failing remote api calls is exceeding the given
		    threshold, Circuit breaker changes its state to OPEN state.

		   Calling microservice will fail immediately and an exception will be returned
		   i.e. execution will be stopped


	3. HALF OPEN State : 

		-->After staying at OPEN state for a given time period breaker will automatically
	           turns its state into HALF OPEN State

		-->In this state limited no.of remote api calls are allowed to pass through
	           If the failing calls count is greater than the limited number, breaker turns
		   again into OPEN state otherwise it is closed
		  



	Circuit Breaker - fault tolerance
	Rate Limiter    - block too many requests
	Time Limiter    - Limit time while calling remote operations
	Retry mechanism - automatic retry for failed operations
	Bulk Head	- limit no.of concurrent requests

		

					----------------------
	no.of users can access this     |offer-details-service|
	is 100k users				-----------------------


	1,00,000 users continuously hitting the service then how to handle the bulk requests

	200k	users continuously hitting the service then how to handle it?		



using Jmeter we can perform load testing. i.e. we can configure 100k, 200k users and start accessing
the application, if the application will not support huge load then it will give error resposne
