Last Session:
============
	
	-->We have discussed on banking project domain
	-->Types of Projects

Today Session:
=============

	Types of project and their importance

	1. Migration Projects
	2. Scratch Level Projects
	3. Enhancement Projects
	4. Migration Or Supported Projects



Migration Projects :
===================

	Migartion can be happend in any one of the scenarios like

	1. Database Migration : sql server to postgres
				postgres 8 to postgres 12

				mainframes to bigdata

	2. Service Level      : jax rpc
				jax rpc to jaxws			100 of microservices/rest api
				jaxws to jax rs
				rest api using microservices

	3. front appns        : angular 2 --- angular3, angular10


	poc -- proof of concept 

		migrate one api from jaxws to rest api
		prepare the documentation with list of tasks, challenges, ..etc

		one api --- 1 resource --- 10  -- 10 * 1000 = 1000 days
							 
			    10 resource -- 10 months 



	4. Performance -----> migarte the project architecture form monolythic to microservices
	   issues


 2. Scratch Level Project:
    ======================

	According to the client requirements, developer need to develop the project from the scratch
	like creating packages, classes..etc	

	client technical person -- he will decide tech stack for the project
	non technical person	-- tech team will take decision on tech statck

	most of the scratch must use latest tech stack

	Advantages :
	===========
	
		1. developer should get complte grip on coding
		2. we can write the resuable, readable, maintainable, understandable..etc
		3. code is unit testable

  3. Enhancement Project:
     ====================

	 Already source code is present, accoring to the client requirements 
	 we need to modify the existing source code

	public class CreditCardOffers{

	public OffersResp getOffers(OffersRequest  request){

		if("master".equals(cardType)){

		   //----- logic
									master card related changes
		}else if( "visa".equals(cardType) ){			  --unit testing

		  //-- logic			 			regression testing
									  --visa, amex cards are
		 }							    not impacting
		  else if( "amex".equals(cardType) ){

		  //-- logic			 

		 }
	}

	}
	}
		 
	
-->understand the existing source code
-->difficult to write the unit testcases
-->take lot of time for regression testing
:
	 

4. support or maintainance project:
   ===============================

	In realtime we have L1 support, L2 support, L3 supports team

	This team will monitor the logs of all the applications in production/live, if any errors
	found then inform to application team

	This team should have strong knowledge on tools like Grafana, Splunk, Data Dog, ..etc

	Advantages :
	===========
