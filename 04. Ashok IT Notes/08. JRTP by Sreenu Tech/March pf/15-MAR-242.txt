Today Session:
==============

4. Support/Maintainance Projects

	In realtime we have L1 support, L2 support, L3 supports team

	This team will monitor the logs of all the applications in production/live, if any errors
	found then inform to application team

	This team should have strong knowledge on tools like Grafana, Splunk, Data Dog, ..etc


     Client has 100 products/projects --- should have knowledge on all the projects? why?

    sreenu --- till 15Match 2024, from April 2024 sreenu will be allocated for new projects

    If any production issue will come in previous/last project then sreenu can't look into that issue
    because he will busy with new project


 developer --- once rollout the project into production -- handover the project to support team

	i.e. dev team should give proper KT to support team, like that every project should handover to 
	support team.

	
		project1 -----------------
		project2 -----------------  =========>handover to production support team
		:
		project20 ----------------

		L1  --- they are not good at coding, only supporting
		L2,L3 -- if any minor changes then they should do the code changes into deploy into production


	Advantages:
	===========

		-->This team should work on tools like grafana, splunk, app dynamics..etc
		-->strong domain knowledge on all the projects
		-->They should have knowledge on shell scripting programings like linux shell scripting..etc

	Drawbacks:
	==========
		-->No coding/development opportunities


  If you get any opportunity on support project, please don't stay long duration
  You should work on support project get the more domain knowledge (SME) and switch to development side
