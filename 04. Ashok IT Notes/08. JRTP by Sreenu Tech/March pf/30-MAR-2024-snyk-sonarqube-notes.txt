	2. Source  Code Quality tools

		 1. Libraries Scanning			2. Source Code Scanning


For every production release,client should have checklist on quality coding, unit testing, library
scanning..etc make sure our source code should reach all the quality gates.

1. Library Security Vluerabilities:
   ===============================

	-->In java libraries means : .jar, .war, .ear
	-->Generally a project will have list of jars (predefined and userdefined)
	-->Security tools are used to scan all libraries in the project and identifies vluerabilities

	Vluenrability:

		"Vluenrability is a quality or state of being exposed to the posibility of being
		attacked or harmed either physically or emotionally"

		-->Vluenrability is a weakness that can be exploited by cybercriminals/hackers to
	           gain unauthorised access to a computer system

		-->After exploiting  a vluerability a hacker can run malicious code, install malware
		    and even steal the sensitive data
			
		   
There are so many security vluerability tools are available in market, some of them are

	1. Snyk
	2. Jfrog
	3. nexus

Snyk:
=====

	-->Snyk was designed to serve as a developer security platform
	-->The main goal of snyk is help us to detect and fix vluerabilities in your application
	   source code, third party depdencies and infrastructure configuration like terraforms, k8s

	"Snyk is used to scan our project dependencies by analysing the libraries and packages that 	our application relies on"


Snyk Setup:
===========

	#1. Installing the Snyk using CLI

		>npm install -g snyk

	#2. Authenticating

		>snyk auth // it will redirect to https//snyk.io and asking  credentials for authenti
		              cation. Once it is success then run the project

	#3. Scan the application

		>snyk test

		This command will scan all the dependencies, analyse dependencies and find the
		vluerabiliites/probelms

		Snyk will provide the detailed report showing the vulenrabiliites

		Each vulenrability has some priority like P1, P2, P3, P4

		 
		Vulenrability -- P1 -- Critical Severity -- we should fix the issue in hours
		Vulenrability -- P2 -- High Severity	 -- we should fix the issue in days like 1 weeks
		Vulenrability -- P3 -- Medium Severity 	 -- we should fix the issue in a month
		Vulenrability -- P4 -- Low Severity      -- we should fix the issue when will get bandwidth


				
-->For every release or any new dependencies added in the project then it is mandatory to run the security
   scanning tool which will take care scan and analyse the dependencies and generte the reports with
   vlunerabilities

-->Developer need to fix and do the regression/unit testing once before move the changes into production
	
==============================================================================================================

Source Code Quality/Anlysis tools:
==================================

	-->Source Code Analysis tool is also known as Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
	-->It is used to analyse the source code of the project and identifies common mistakes done by
	   the developer
	-->There are so many SAST tools are available in market, some of them are
	
		a. PMD : Programmer Mistake detector
		b. SonarQube
		c. Findbugs
		d. Checkmarx
		e. CheckStyle
		
		

 SonarQube:
 =========

	-->It is an source code analyser tool, used for analysing the source code identify the common mistakes
	   done by the developer

	-->It is used to help for developer to write the clean code

	   clean cod is nothing but the code that results in secure, realiable, maintainble..etc

	-->SonarQube will generate the reports with all the issues/mistakes

	-->There are 3 types of issues : 1. Bug		2. Vlunerability	3. Code Smell


1. Bug :  A coding mistake that can lead to an error or unexpected behaviour ar tuntime

2. Vlunerability : A point in your code that's open to attack

3. Code Smell  : A maintainability issues that makes your code confusing and difficult to maintain


The severity of the issue is determined based on its impact on the software quality, There are 3 levels of sevirity/priority, They are 1. High	2. Medium	3. Low

1. High (P1/Sev1):

	-->Issues with a high probablity to impact the behaviour of the application in production
	-->For ex users can't able to login appn, a memory leaks, unclosed data base connections, an empty 
	   catch block, SQL injection..etc

		http://keybank.com/offers?cardnum=

2. Medium (P2/Sev2):

	-->A quality flaw that can highly impact the developers productivity

	   ex : uncovered peice of code, duplicate blocks, unused parameters, Sop shouldn't use..etc

3. Low (P3/Sev3) : 

	-->A quality flaw that can slightly impact the developers productivity

	    ex : lises should not be too long, unused import statements, switch stmt should have atleast 3 		 cases


	Priority	 old severity		new severity(mapping)

	 P1     	 Blocker, Critical		 High

	 P2     	 Major				Medium

	 P3		 Minor, Info			 Low


	
	
3 types of issues 

	1. Bug 		 : P1, P2, P3
	2. Vlunerability : P1, P2, P3
	3. Code Smell    : P1, P2, P3



How to install/setup sonarqube software:
========================================

	There are 2 types of sonarqube softwares

		1. sonarlint  2. sonarqubeserver
		

	1. sonarlint : 

		-->we need install sonalint pluging in IDE
		-->It provides immediate feedback in your IDE as you write the code and you can find
		    and fix issues before a commit

	2. sonarqube server:

	-->It is an opensource software and in the form of zip file
	-->sonarqube server zip file freely from https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/downloads/
	-->extract the zip file

	--> start sonarqube

D:\Srenu-Backup\softwares\sonarqube-8.9.10.61524\sonarqube-8.9.10.61524\bin\windows-x86-64>startsonar.bat

	3. using docker we can install the sonarqube server

		>docker pull sonarqube:latest
		>doker run -d --name sonarqube -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:latest

Access the sonarqube using 

URL : http://localhost:9000/
credentials : uname:pwd : admin:admin
	
How to enable sonarqube software:
=================================

	1. add the below sonarqube build plugins in pom.xml

	2. goto the project location, run the sonarqube tool

		>mvn clean install sonar:sonar  -Dsonar.projectkey=offers-project
						-Dsonar.projectName=Project_name
						-Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000
						-Dsonar.token=34080dd5d5f8e3f7f3576361992b93975de16dda
								
mvn sonar:sonar  -Dsonar.projectKey=offers-project  -Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000 -Dsonar.login=34080dd5d5f8e3f7f3576361992b93975de16dda


	mvn sonar:sonar \
  -Dsonar.projectKey=offers-project \
  -Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000 \
  -Dsonar.login=34080dd5d5f8e3f7f3576361992b93975de16dda
