	4. admin module    : This module is used for business team where business team can

Requirements:
============

	1. A customer max get 10 offers out of 'N' offers
	2. Business team will prioritise these offers for the customers view
	   i.e. always generalized offers are least priority and where as membership offers are 		highest priority

	3. As per business requirements the offers order would be 

			a. membership offers - moffers
			b. personalized offers - poffers
			c. generalized offers  - goffers

	4. Always we should send atmost 10 offers to the customers as per below order

		a. if m-offers >= 10 then send only 10 moffers by ignoring other offers
		b. if m-offers < 10 then how many offers count for <10 . (ex : moffers - 5, ..etc)
		   get the remaining offers from p-offers

			ex : 1. m-offers = 10 ---> ignore p-offers, g-offers
			ex : 2. m-offers = 4  ----> get 6 from p-offers and ignore g-offers

				10 = m-offers + p-offers + g-offers
				10 = 10 + 0 + 0
				10 = 4 + 6 + 0

			add remaining poffers to reach the count for 10 offers.

				
                 c. The combination of m-offers and p-offers <10 then goto g-offers, get remaining 
		    offers from g-offers

			ex :  m-offers = 4, p-offers=5, g-offers=1

				10 = m-offers + p-offers + g-offers
				10 =  0 + 0 + 10 
				10 =  0 + 9 + 1
				10 =  3 + 4 + 3
		

	 	Summary : max up to 10 offers
		
			10 = m-offers + p-offers + g-offers

			10 = 0 + 0 + 9 (m-offers =0, p-offers = 0,g-offers = 9)
			10 = 2 + 2 + 6 (m-offers =2, p-offers = 2,g-offers = 20)
			10 = 5 + 0 + 5 (m-offers =5, p-offers = 0,g-offers = 50)
			10 = 9 + 1 + 0 (m-offers =9, p-offers = 20,g-offers = 5)
			10 = 6 + 6 + 0 (m-offers =6, p-offers = 4,g-offers = 9)
			10 = 4 + 2 + 3 (m-offers =4, p-offers = 2,g-offers = 3)

	5. The combination of m-offers, p-offers or m-offers, p-offers and g-offers ..etc
	   will reach morethan/greaterthan 10 then consider the offers which expired near time

		
	   		10 = 0 + 0 + 9 (m-offers =0, p-offers = 0,g-offers = 9)
			10 = 2 + 2 + 6 (m-offers =2, p-offers = 2,g-offers = 20)
			10 = 5 + 0 + 5 (m-offers =5, p-offers = 0,g-offers = 50)
			10 = 9 + 1 + 0 (m-offers =9, p-offers = 20,g-offers = 5)
			10 = 6 + 6 + 0 (m-offers =6, p-offers = 4,g-offers = 9)
			10 = 4 + 2 + 3 (m-offers =4, p-offers = 2,g-offers = 3)

		For every offers will have expiry date, consider which offer expdate will near date
		from current date and get those offers.
