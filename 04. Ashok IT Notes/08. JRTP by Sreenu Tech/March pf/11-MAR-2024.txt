	Project Architectures: 

		-->Project Architecture means, how the different systems can communicate with each other
		-->There are 2 types of architectures

			microservices  :

				i. discovery client 2. ribbon client 3. feign client

			a. only first time will goto backend from next time get the data from cache
			b. imporve the application performance
			c. save the cost
